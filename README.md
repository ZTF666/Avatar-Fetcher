# Avatar | アバター

Is a webapp that uses the multiple end points provided by [Kiko Beats](https://github.com/Kikobeats) to fetch and display a given user's profile picture .

This was made just to put a UI on the already existing project.
Since i've used to links quit a lot lately , i wanted to make it more accessible
for me or anyone else who's interested .

You can always refer to the original project here :
