# Avatar | アバター

Is a webapp that uses the multiple end points provided by [Kiko Beats](https://github.com/Kikobeats) to fetch and display a given user's profile picture .

This was made just to put a UI on the already existing project.
Since i've used to links quit a lot lately , i wanted to make it more accessible
for me or anyone else who's interested .

You can always refer to the original project here :

[Unavatar](https://github.com/Kikobeats/unavatar)

## How does it work :

-**Project setup**

```
pnpm install
```

-**Compiles and hot-reloads for development**

```
pnpm run serve
```

-**Compiles and minifies for production**

```
pnpm run build
```
